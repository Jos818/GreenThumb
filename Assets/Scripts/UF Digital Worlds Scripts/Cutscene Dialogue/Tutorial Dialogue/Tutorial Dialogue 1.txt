What's this giant book?
...
"Magical Forest Gardening: Survive and Thrive"
I get the impression I should read this.
...
"The Magical Forest is one of the most dangerous places you can ever find yourself."
"To survive, you'll need all the brainpower, agility, and gardening prowess you can muster."
"As a lover-of-plants, your most potent tool, after your mind, is your watering can."
"Pressing SPACE to water suspicious piles of dirt is the best thing you can do in a pinch."
...
What am I, a beginner? I know how to use a watering can.
Still, I should probably keep an eye out for books like these, there might be helpful information in them.

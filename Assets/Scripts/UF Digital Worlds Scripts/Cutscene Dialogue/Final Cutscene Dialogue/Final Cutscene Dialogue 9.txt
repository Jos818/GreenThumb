[NAME=Player][PITCH=2]First off, that sounds awful.
I have NO interest in doing any of that.
What kind of magic setting is "The Hallway of Guys With Shivs" anyway?
[NAME=Poorly-Worded Wish Fairy][PITCH=1]I assure you it's quite whimisical and fun!
[NAME=Player][PITCH=2]Sure it is.
Secondly, I think you and I both know that there's no way that's going to work.
[NAME=Poorly-Worded Wish Fairy][PITCH=1]Whatever do you mean?
[NAME=Player][PITCH=2]This game has to be finished soon, and there's no shot the developer has time to make all of that.
[NAME=Poorly-Worded Wish Fairy][PITCH=1]Um, I'm sure that's not true...
[NAME=Player][PITCH=2]The way I see it, this story needs a conclusion ASAP.
If you send me home, everyone gets a happily-ever-after and no one asks about unfinished content.
